# Completed Projects

## 🛠️ Cloud Disaster Recovery
A comprehensive cross-region disaster recovery solution built on AWS that automatically handles failover when primary infrastructure fails. This project implements automated traffic routing using AWS Global Accelerator, CloudWatch monitoring for health checks, and SSM Automation for seamless failover orchestration. When disaster strikes, the system automatically starts backup servers in a secondary region and redirects traffic without manual intervention, ensuring zero-downtime recovery and peace of mind for critical applications.

## 🚀 TechHealth Migration
A comprehensive AWS infrastructure migration that transformed a healthcare startup's "click-and-pray" console-based infrastructure into a robust, compliant Infrastructure as Code solution. This project solved critical challenges including security group chaos, undocumented resources, and the inability to recreate environments reliably.

## 🚁 Serverless Travel Contact Form
What started as a "simple contact form" became a fully automated, AWS-powered serverless architecture that handles customer travel inquiries end-to-end. This project showcases real-world serverless patterns including automated email confirmations, data validation, and scalable infrastructure that processes hundreds of submissions for under $5/month.

## 📋 TaskUp Now - Serverless Task Manager
A fully serverless task management application that demonstrates modern cloud-native architecture principles. Built to solve the problem of losing important tasks due to browser crashes, this application leverages AWS services for automatic scaling, cost optimization, and enterprise-grade reliability. Features include AI-powered image analysis with AWS Rekognition, real-time task management, and direct S3 uploads with presigned URLs.

## 🔒 CloudSecure - AI Threat Detection
A complete AI-powered Security Operations Center built on AWS that demonstrates real threat detection capabilities for under $100. This project moves beyond compliance theater to deliver actual working security architecture with Zero Trust network design, AI-powered threat detection via GuardDuty, and real-time visualization through Grafana dashboards.

## ⚙️ Ansible for Beginners
A comprehensive infrastructure automation project that demonstrates core Ansible concepts through practical implementation. This project moves beyond tutorial-level examples to showcase real-world configuration management, featuring one Ansible control node managing two web servers with dynamic content generation, all deployed via Infrastructure as Code.
